Augmented Reality in Education and Gaming: Advantages and Disadvantages _ QAEDIT_EDIT2
Education
   Augmented reality plays a variety of roles and has significant applications in all aspects of education. This is influencing the traditional educational strategy that has been employed and is not simply setting a trend for new learning methods and education for the modern day.
 Advantages
   The classroom will be interactive. They can let their creativity and imagination run wild, ask questions based on the material, and be capable of drawing connections between several related subjects in order to gain comprehensive and applicable knowledge of the subjects discussed. This not only helps them establish the ideas they have acquired in the classrooms, but it also makes it easier for them to interact with the instructors and other students. That will make the learning interesting. The majority of educational learning apps and platforms include augmented reality-based learning, designed to help students in their present studies while also promoting the fact that it helps them improve their grades by better understanding the material. Through this learning, students are able to make the most of their comprehension and imaginative abilities, which make them interested in the subject and lead them to prefer deep learning over traditional education. With this, the use of augmented reality in the classroom has the potential to quickly replace outdated teaching methods and reading from textbooks. However, since everything cannot be converted to technology right away, one should begin by combining an AR-based learning strategy with a traditional textbook-based strategy. Additionally, AR-based applications and animations can be added to current textbooks and lesson plans to enhance them. These applications function when a code is scanned on a specific app for studying. This can begin with a few themes and eventually end in an electronic version of the complete course material from both the instructor's and student's perspectives.
Disadvantages
    The use of augmented reality is not as simple and obvious as it first seems. The creation of an AR experience for the user that feels natural takes a lot of work, and there are numerous ways in which customers could abuse your product. Costs are a big factor in augmented reality's drawbacks.
    The first downside of choosing augmented reality is its high cost. Some AR apps are too complicated for the typical user, and they are expensive to produce. Depending on how difficult you want your app or marketing strategy to be, the price of an app may go up. Only a select few large organizations have this advantage because not everyone has the money to invest in augmented reality technology. Due to increasing costs, smaller businesses would likewise be unable to purchase this equipment. Adoption challenges exist for augmented reality in education. First off, there is no guarantee that AR technologies will be widely used on a worldwide scale if they become mainstream. Additionally, AR and other metaverse concepts have not yet entered the mainstream. It involves the initial phase of rejection and mockery that most emergent technical advances go through.
   As with other newly developed technologies, it's critical to understand that augmented reality is still in its beginnings and will continue to develop as some of its challenges are resolved. The advantages and disadvantages of augmented reality go farther to help you comprehend its incredible economic opportunities and risks for personal use even though its future is uncertain. Everything else is dependent on how businesses and governments react to the technological advancement.
Gaming
    Some people were curious about the benefits of playing an augmented reality game over a conventional mobile game without this technology. It appears from reading multiple responses on Twitter that many people don't understand why there is a need for this technology in the gaming business because they believe it isn't suitable for gaming or that it isn't engaging enough. In fact, some AR gaming experiences have failed and left you wondering why a game developer chose to incorporate AR in the first place. However, some gaming projects, such as Pok√©mon Go, have undoubtedly been successful in capturing people's hearts as a result of AR technology.



Advantages
    The ability to engage with a conventional non-AR mobile game while experiencing a physical sensation is essentially nonexistent, or at the very least, the alternatives are severely constrained. Haptic feedback is the only thing that even comes close. Because AR glasses free up your hands, you can use a special kind of controller that improves the game's sense of physicality. Such as using a controller that resembles a gun in the real world, interacting with a real-world game object, etc. Additionally, I've heard of augmented reality (AR) gloves that should produce more accurate haptic feedback and even allow you to feel various materials. Body-based movements that aren't available in typical mobile games can be used when playing an AR game using AR glasses. Even though the gyroscope can be used to track rotation, this is different from what computer vision can do. Think about being able to spread your hands wide, perform a spell like a wizard, or extend your hand out in front to make a shield. Due to the similarities between human movement and in-game physical action, these body gestures are ideal for many different types of games and can provide a more exciting and authentic gameplay experience. Traditional gaming is an individual hobby. However, you can play the game collaboratively with others using augmented reality. Users can become more bonded through the creation of cooperative games. In games, you can also create multiplayer using augmented reality. As an example, AR games can put you and other players through simulated treasure hunts, etc. Additionally, you can work together with other players to capture virtual animals. This improves social interaction. A good example is working together with your family to defend your house from imaginary invaders. This develops a sense of togetherness.
Disadvantages
   The extremely high price of virtual reality games is one of their biggest downsides. Unfortunately, not everyone can afford to purchase the device and utilize its features. causes a sense of worthlessness and loneliness. A player who spends too much time in augmented reality could experience loneliness outside of the game. It is a risky encounter that has the potential to lead to serious emotional and psychological illnesses that cause addiction in people. People who play augmented reality games on a regular basis run the risk of developing a virtual-world addiction. The effects could be severe, hurting both one's physical health and general well-being and making human connections less effective. Some of the most significant advantages of augmented reality are simple communication and the better possibility of forming new relationships. The experience is frequently harmful, prohibiting students from having straightforward face-to-face conversations and real-world encounters. without any kind of adaptability. You are utterly mistaken if you think that experiencing freedom through augmented reality will be something new for you. You must follow the program's path while playing virtual reality games, which presents you with a few options and provides misleading instructions. It's not guaranteed that you'll feel as confident, outgoing, and determined in real life as you do in an augmented reality game.
