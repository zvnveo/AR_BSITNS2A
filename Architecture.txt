Architecture of Augmented Reality

Augmented Reality Architecture is often divided into three major components: 
(1)the Infrastructures Unit, 
(2)the Processing Unit, 
(3)and the Visual Unit. 

The Infrastructure Tracker Unit was in charge of gathering data from the real world and transferring it to the Processing Unit, 
which blended the virtual information with the real content and sent the result to the Visual Unit's Video Out module.  
The Visual Unit can be divided into two sorts of systems based on the visualization technologies used: 

(1)Video see-through: It uses a closed-view Head-Mounted Display that uses video-mixing to display the combxined images. 
(2)Optical see-through: It makes use of a Head-Mounted Display that combines the pictures within an open-view Head-Mounted Display using optical combiners.
