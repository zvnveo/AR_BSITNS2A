  The study includes an in-depth analysis of augmented reality environments and 
ap1plications commonly used in designing learning and teaching environments in 
education using digitization processes. As a general research finding; today,
with the introduction of technology into the educational environment, different
tools and materials are used in teaching methods. In this context, we can see 
that the inclusion of mobile tools and mobile applications in the learning 
environment has become widespread recently. With this rapid development of 
mobile technology, a new, increasingly interactive media environment is 
increasing the number of services offered to users. One environment that can 
provide this interaction and integrate objects into real objects and virtual 
environments is a technology that provides "Augmented Reality" (AR). These 
techniques allow virtual objects to be superimposed on real images. AR tools 
consist of cameras, computer infrastructure, markers, and tangible objects. 
   AR can not only enhance the gaming experience, but also have a positive 
impact on cognitive development, social interaction and physical activity. 
AR games foster problem-solving, critical thinking, and decision-making while 
facilitating collaboration and communication between players. AR games can also 
promote physical activity and outdoor play. This is especially important for a 
child or her teen who spends a lot of time in front of a screen. 
    Based on the findings of this research paper, we would like to recommend .the use of augmented reality (AR) technology in both education and gaming. 
The results indicate that AR has the potential to enhance the learning and gaming 
experiences of users by providing a more engaging and interactive environment.
    However, It's important to recognize the risks of using augmented reality, including increased screen time, potential addiction, physical harm, and privacy concerns. These risks must be carefully considered and mitigated. However, the benefits of using AR in gaming and education outweigh the risks, as it can revolutionize how we learn and play games.We recommend further research to explore the full potential of AR technology in education and gaming, including its impact on learning outcomes, engagement, and motivation.
