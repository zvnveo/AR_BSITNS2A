 Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that has gained widespread attention in recent years due to its potential to revolutionize the way people interact with the world around them. This technology blends virtual elements into a user's real-world environment, creating an interactive experience that combines both digital and physical elements.  It enhances the perception of the physical world by overlaying digital information or objects onto the user's view of the real environment. AR systems integrate real-time computer-generated images or sounds with the user's physical environment, creating a new composite environment in which the virtual and real worlds coexist.
   The concept of AR is based on the idea of overlaying computer-generated sensory inputs such as graphics, sound, and haptic feedback onto the physical world in real-time. The technology requires a device with a camera, sensors, and a screen to capture the user's surroundings. The camera captures the user's view of the physical environment, and the computer processes the image and overlays digital information onto it. The AR system tracks the user's movements in real-time, allowing the digital content to move and change as the user moves. This content can be in the form of 3D models, text, images, or animations that appear in real-time, creating an immersive and interactive experience.
