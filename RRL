According to the study conducted by Li, M. and Liu, L. (2022). 

The questionnaire survey covered environmental interactivity, system quality and textbook content. 
It was found that learners who used mobile learning augmented reality (MLAR) generally managed to 
browse all the contents of the textbook at each learning location, without spending too much time 
looking for information, and learners could quickly integrate this into the learning situation. 
Learners who used MLAR had a strong motivation to study plants at the learning site because they 
wanted to use the augmented reality technology to observe virtual plant models. Learners who used 
MLAR in their field learning liked using augmented reality for further learning, for example, 
using a magic wand to interact with the technology.
